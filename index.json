SE-ABMs are models that simulate the fate of entities at the individual level within a spatial context and where patterns emerge at the population level. NetLogoR follows the same framework as the NetLogo software (Wilensky 1999). Rather than a call function to use the NetLogo software, NetLogoR is a translation into the R language of the structure and functions of NetLogo. Models built with NetLogoR are written in R language and are run on the R platform; no other software or language has to be involved. NetLogoR provides new R classes to define model agent objects and functions to implement spatially explicit agent-based models in the R environment. Users of this package benefit from the fast and easy coding provided by the highly developed NetLogo framework, coupled with the versatility, power and massive resources of the R language.","tags":[],"title":"NetLogoR: A package to build and run spatially explicit agent-based models in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex M.

The accessibility of blood hosts and availability of plant sugar (i.e., nectar) sources, together with mosquito energy state, have been shown to modulate blood feeding (and thus biting rates) of anopheline mosquitoes. In this study, the influence of mosquito starvation status and availability of nectar on the decision of female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes to leave a bed net-protected blood host was examined. Methods Two small-scale mesocosm experiments were conducted using female mosquitoes starved for 0, 24 or 48 hours, that were released inside a specially constructed hut with mesh-sealed exits and containing a bed net-protected human volunteer. Floral cues were positioned on one side of the hut or the other. Several exponential decay models were developed that characterized the emigration rates from the huts. These model fits were evaluated by examining their fitted parameter estimates, comparing Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores. Results Starved mosquitoes left domiciles at a higher rate than recently fed individuals however, there was no difference between one-day and two-day-starved mosquitoes. There was also no effect of floral cue placement on mosquito emigration rates. The best fitting emigration model was one based on both mosquito energy state and time whereas the worst fitting model was one based on the assumption of constant leaving rates, independent of time and energy state. Conclusions The results confirm that mosquito-leaving behaviour is energy-state dependent, and provide some of the first evidence state-dependent domicile emigration in An. gambiae, which may play a role in malarial transmission dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"State-dependent domicile leaving rates in Anopheles gambiae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eliot J.

The evolution of a feeding phenotype involves complex interactions with many factors other than resource choice alone, including environmental heterogeneity, resource quality, availability, and interactions with other organisms. We applied an evolutionary simulation model to examine how ecological conditions shape evolution of feeding phenotypes (e.g., omnivory), by varying the quality and availability (absolute and relative) of plant and animal (prey) resources. Resulting feeding phenotypes were defined by the relative contribution of plants and prey to diets of individuals. We characterized organisms using seven traits that were allowed to evolve freely in different simulated environments, and we asked which traits are important for different feeding phenotypes to evolve among interacting organisms. Carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores all coexisted without any requirement in the model for a synergistic effect of eating plant and animal prey. Omnivores were most prevalent when ratio of plants and animal prey was low, and to a lesser degree, when habitat productivity was high. A key result of the model is that omnivores evolved through many different combinations of trait values and environmental contexts. Specific combinations of traits tended to form emergent trait complexes, and under certain environmental conditions, are expressed as omnivorous feeding phenotypes. The results indicate that relative availabilities of plants and prey (over the quality of resources) determine an individual's feeding class and that feeding phenotypes are often the product of convergent evolution of emergent trait complexes under specific environmental conditions. Foraging outcomes appear to be consequences of degree and type of phenotypic specialization for plant and animal prey, navigation and exploitation of the habitat, reproduction, and interactions with other individuals in a heterogeneous environment. Omnivory should not be treated as a fixed strategy, but instead a pattern of phenotypic expression, emerging from diverse genetic sources and coevolving across a range of ecological contexts.","tags":[],"title":"On the evolution of omnivory in a community context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex M.

When substantial variation in individual dispersal capability is present, these constraints may have significant impacts on populations where condition-dependent evaluation of habitat sites interacts with state-dependent habitat selection. Latty and Reid (2010) hypothesize that internal state of the dispersers and characteristics of their habitat mediate habitat selection ('condition matching'). Hypothesis: Individual beetles in better energetic condition are more likely to attack better-defended trees (i.e. riskier habitat). Organism: Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins). Field sites: Two field sites were used, and work at both sites coincided with the start of the beetles' emergence and flight period. Beetles used for lipid extraction analysis were collected near Merritt, BC, Canada in 2006, and host tree acceptance experiments were performed in 2010 near Field, BC, Canada. Methods: We sampled a population of beetles to characterize the relationship between beetle size and lipid content, then examined the variation in individual somatic energy condition and date of emergence. We separately tested the effect of somatic energetic condition on habitat (host) selection decisions by experimentally manipulating beetles' somatic energy reserves, placing them on host trees of different nutritional qualities, and measuring the latency in beetles' host tree acceptance. Results: Most beetles emerged early. Their somatic energy condition is higher at the start of the emergence period than near the end, although there is substantial individual variation in both timing and condition upon beetle emergence. Beetles' host selection decisions are influenced by both host tree nutritional quality and individuals' lipid reserves. Good nutritional quality trees are accepted sooner than poor nutritional quality trees. Individuals with lower energy reserves are less selective, accepting poorer quality host trees sooner than beetles with higher energy reserves.","tags":[],"title":"To tree or not to tree: The role of energy limitation on host tree acceptance in a bark beetle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex M.

Settlement decisions in MPB depend on complex interactions among the size and nutritional quality of the host tree, its defensive capabilities, beetle attack densities, and beetles' energy reserves. Limited somatic energy reserves and time available for dispersal and habitat search impose restrictions on individuals' settlement decisions, and can have substantial effects on the resulting population distributions. I characterized the variation in individual somatic condition and timing of emergence in a field population of beetles and tested the effect of somatic condition on beetles' habitat settlement decisions. I derived, from first principles, a dynamic state variable model of inter-stand dispersal and tree selection by individual beetles. The model and experimental results showed that considerable individual variation exists and that settlement decisions are modulated both by the beetle's lipid reserves and tree nutritional quality. This model provided the foundation for a spatial dynamic game model of beetle attack on multiple host tree species. I examined how the predicted evolutionarily stable strategies differ for beetles utilizing different pine species, and examined the resulting population distributions on these different tree species. Finally, using beetle dispersal estimates obtained from the dynamic game model, I explored the spread of an engineered genetic control element through MPB populations and describe how such control may be effective to suppress beetle outbreaks. I discuss the utility of considering individual variation together with state- and condition-dependent behaviours in assessing population-level phenomena.","tags":[],"title":"Individual host selection decisions and population-level responses in a time- and energy-limited forager, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alex M.

Investment in the ability to exploit one resource may make it more difficult to exploit a second alternate resource, thereby disfavouring the evolution of generalists. Across the continuum of feeding classes, from specialists on animal prey (carnivory) to specialists on plants (herbivory), the generalist strategy of omnivory should thus be a rare strategy yet omnivores are common in nature; so is it possible to reconcile observation with theory? We consider the evolution of omnivory in the context of interactions between foragers and their environment. We use an evolutionary simulation model to consider a community of individuals that are described by their feeding strategy, broadly classified as three feeding types – herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores – and ask how the intrinsic properties of these foragers and their environment determines the prevalence of omnivores (and other feeding types). We examined the traits associated with omnivores as well as the other feeding types and further examined the environmental factors (i.e., quality and availability of plant and animal prey in the environment) that lead to an increase in omnivore prevalence. Results/Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that the phenotype (i.e., the proportion of plant items to prey items in the diet) of all feeding classes (including omnivores) is both readily predictable and explainable based upon the underlying intrinsic abilities (i.e., trait complexes) of an individual and its environment. Omnivores tend to have nutritional traits that are intermediate in value to carnivores and herbivores, but that are biased towards the acquisition and assimilation of animal prey. The trait values that describe an omnivore (or other feeding types) differed as a function of the environment, suggesting that how we describe omnivores is dependent on both the intrinsic characteristics of the organism, interactions with others, and the availability and quality of resources. Our model suggests that omnivores are ubiquitous across all environmental conditions, although for the most part are not the dominant feeding type. Omnivores are most prevalent when the ratio between plants and animal prey numbers is low, and to a lesser degree, when habitat productivity (i.e., absolute resource quality and availability) is high.","tags":[""],"title":"On the evolution of omnivory in a community context","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Whenever I used to sit down in front of the computer to write anything other than an email, I would immediately open Microsoft Word and start clacking away on the keyboard. When I switched operating systems (away from Windows) I began using Open Office Writer and even now I still use Libre Office Writer for some of my writing needs. Each of these word processors offer similar sets of tools and can effectively be used for a wide range of writing tasks, from letters to essays, yet I feel most people use Word not because it's always the best tool for the job, but because it's ubiquitous and familiar.\nThere are plenty of limitations to using Word (and Writer), especially when it comes to 1) complex formatting (especially working with equations), 2) sharing documents and collaborating with others, 3) version control, and 4) converting to different file types.\nTo overcome these limitations and to make writing easier, I want to share my favourite writing tools \u0026ndash; Markdown and LaTeX, which use plain-text file formats and can be easily converted to any other file type with Pandoc.\nThe use of plain text format is important. Version control software like Git works perfectly with plain-text files, showing you which lines have changed between versions. However, this version differencing isn't possible using binary file formats like those used by Word (.doc and .docx). Additionally, you can open plain-text files on any computer without any special (proprietary!) software, so 10 years from now when you want to revisit an old document, you can do so without having to ensure you keep an old computer with old software around.\nYou shouldn't have to worry about formatting Markdown and LaTeX files are markup languages, which means that the text in a document is annotated in a way that indicates the structure and formatting of the text, using tags. For example, bolded text in HTML(used for webpages) would be written like this: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;bold text here\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;. Markdown makes this even simpler, so you spend less time formatting your document while writing, which means you can focus on actually writing rather than formatting.\nIt's fantastically easy to learn the markdown syntax and create documents with markdown:\n# Simple Headings ## And Subheadings Here's some paragraph text with some words *emphasized* with italics. Others are **bolded** for emphasis. ### Don't Forget Subsubheadings You can keep adding headings and subheadings by using more hashes! # What about lists? - lists are easy to make - just use 4 spaces for sub-points - numbered lists are also supported # Markdown is great for embedding code too You just put your code `inside the backticks` or use blocks of code. # Blockquotes are just as easy \u0026gt; Look at me go! Check out [Markdown basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to learn more. The markdown text above produces this:\nAnd it doesn't stop there. Markdown also supports citations and references with bibtex, which means that you can easily write up that thesis chapter or manuscript, not worrying about the final format until you're ready to convert your markdown file to whatever file format you require.\nEquations and more! Markdown is incredibly easy to learn, and will cover most of your writing needs, but if you are (or will be) making heavy use of code, equations, and statistics, then you need to be using LaTeX. The syntax is more complex than Markdown, but it hands-down beats MS Word for formatting, equation typesetting, and portability between computers. I've done all my thesis stuff, including manuscripts, in LaTeX and output as PDF or converted to .doc format when needed.\nTo make your introduction to LaTeX easier, I recommend starting out using an editor like Texmaker, which is cross platform and come with a GUI to assist with inserting various document elements. If you will be using equations, you'll want to make sure you use the amsmath package. There are a lot of other great packages for latex which will help with everything from document formatting and layout, to citation formatting with bibtex, as well as adding coffee stains to your pdf documents. I also recommend checking out the TeX Stack Exchange site to get Q\u0026amp;A help with everything (La)TeX.\nGoing further and using R+LaTeX+Sweave and you've got yourself a full-on powerhouse of reproducible, portable document publishing. Also remember, .tex files are simply a type of text file, so they work with version control software like Git.\nFile conversion with Pandoc Lastly, I'll quickly mention that the best way to take your Markdown and LaTeX documents and convert them to almost any type of document file including (e.g., .tex, .html, .pdf, .doc, .odt) is using Pandoc. It's a simple command-line tool, and using it is incredibly straightforward.\nUse them everyday Like any new software, there is a bit of a learning curve, so the best way to get used to it is simply to use it. Using markdown for everyday note taking or creating and maintaining your cv with markdown/LaTeX are great ways to gain familiarity with these tools. Start using them today. Start using them with your collaborators. You (and they) won't be disappointed.\n","date":1373846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1373846400,"objectID":"60432874f4483ad138e3391f9d70d3e4","permalink":"https://alexchubaty.com/post/2013-07-15-essential-software-for-biology-grad-students-part-iii-writing-tools/","publishdate":"2013-07-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-07-15-essential-software-for-biology-grad-students-part-iii-writing-tools/","section":"post","summary":"Whenever I used to sit down in front of the computer to write anything other than an email, I would immediately open Microsoft Word and start clacking away on the keyboard.

Back up. Your data. Simple, yet for various reasons many people simply don't. Backing up data and documents is critical in the event of random computer (or, more likely, user) failure. Losing your data sucks. I have seen too many frantic colleagues try to get at data on a failed hard drive: many had some (but not all) of their most important data backed up, but others were left with few options and resorted to spending hundreds of dollars on data recovery assistance.\nUnfortunately, even when people do attempt to make (and regularly use) backups of their data, they either don't backup everything or they backup so infrequently that they end up losing a day's, or a week's, or even a month's worth of work. So in order for a backup regimen to actually protect your data, the key is to 1) backup everything, and 2) back up often. I'll also add that you should 3) keep a remote copy in the event that something happens to your primary backup.\nIdeally, a backup solution will deal with all three of these points, and I'll discuss some options below.\nExternal hard drives or USB drives Hard drives are cheap, and the storage capacity of portable external hard drives is huge. You can buy a 2TB external drive for under $100. So, for relatively low cost, you can effectively back up all of your data (music and movies included) to and external hard drive and be done with it, right?\nNot quite. The problem with using an external hard drive is that you need to remember to plug it in and backup your computer at least once a day in order to keep your backups current. Not only that, but you will also need to ensure you have a remote copy somewhere in case you lose or damage your external hard drive.\nNetwork Attached Storage I like NAS devices because, like external hard drive they aren't too expensive, yet they overcome the limitation of having to remember to manually initiate backups. Basically, a NAS device plugs into your router and sits on the network, allowing you (or others on your network) to access the files stored. All you need to do is configure your computer's operating system to backup to the NAS, and voila! If anything happens and you need to restore from backup you simply tell your computer to restore from the NAS.\nThe downside is that your backups will only run when you are connected to the network on which the NAS resides. So if you go away to a conference for a few days, or you have a super-productive day at school, you'd better make sure nothing happens to your data before you get home to backup the work! You'll also need to keep a remote backup copy handy.\nEmail One way of ensuring you have a remote copy of your work is to email it to yourself. This works fine once in a while, but if you were to email every file to yourself every time you made changes, you'd likely fill up your inbox or go crazy. Plus, something will probably slip through.\nUniversity FTP Server I should probably mention that most Universities do provide online storage for their students - usually a couple gigabytes\u0026rsquo; worth - that is accessible over FTP or similar. It's worth checking out, even if it doesn't give you much storage space.\nThe Cloud In the last several years there has been a huge increase not only in the number of online cloud storage providers but also a increase in the amount of free storage space they offer their users. These cloud storage providers offer a desktop client that runs on your computer and continuously monitors changes to files, which are then uploaded to the storage servers. Thus you can hit all three \u0026ldquo;must haves\u0026rdquo; with these services: your files all get backed up, in real time, and you maintain remote copies of your data.\nI personally use Dropbox, but other options include UbuntuOne, SpiderOak, and others. These services give you several GB worth of online storage and allow you to keep your files synchronized across multiple computers, and can also be accessed via web interface. These cloud storage providers give you more space with a paid account, but with Dropbox at least, I get additional space for signing up with an educational email address and for every referral I make (the referee also gets bonus space). Space hasn't been an issue for me.\nThe other awesome feature of Dropbox is that it provides version control.Using the web interface, you can view previous versions of your files, and also roll back changes to restore previous versions or undelete things from your Dropbox. It also provides good collaboration options, allowing you to create shared folders for group projects.\nOne warning: BC Privacy Legislation prohibits storing personal information on non-Canadian servers. This means that, for example as a TA or instructor, you can't store student grades etc. using cloud storage, because the servers are located in the USA.\nSummary Overall, the easiest way to have automated backups is to use a cloud storage provider like Dropbox. Although the free plans have limited storage space, the limits are easily increased. Besides, you can't beat \u0026ldquo;no fuss\u0026rdquo; when it comes to backing up your work! However, in practice I do use some combinations of the other backup methods, depending on the type of data and how much there is to move between computers.\nVersion Control As mentioned above, some cloud storage/backup providers offer version control, which allows you to view and revert changes made to your files. Dropbox certainly does a good job at this, and the undelete feature has saved me on several occasions. However, the main drawback of Dropbox's version control is that it operates on a per file basis.\nOften when writing papers (or code), I trash or substantially rewrite something, only later to realize that what I overwrote wasn't that bad. Hitting ctrl-z will undo the changes, but it also means it will undo any progress you've made. Restoring previous version of your document using Dropbox will get you an old copy, but you still have to hunt around to find exactly which version you want to restore. And what if you actually want to incorporate changes from multiple restored files?\nThis is where \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; version control software (VCS) comes in handy. Now, I'm new to the VCS game, having only started using Gitthis year, but already I can see its power and potential. If you're working with text files - be it a paper written in Markdown (maybe LaTeX), or chunks of code - you will want to use Git.\nThis post has run rather long, so I won't be providing a \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo;, but GitHub provides great help getting started. You don't need to use GitHub at all to use Git - you can keep everything local (in a Dropbox folder!) and still have access to all of your project files. Try it. Use it.\n","date":1373500800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1373500800,"objectID":"bfbeea96245985eff328ff799e157b14","permalink":"https://alexchubaty.com/post/2013-07-11-essential-software-for-biology-grad-students-part-ii-backups-and-sync/","publishdate":"2013-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2013-07-11-essential-software-for-biology-grad-students-part-ii-backups-and-sync/","section":"post","summary":"Always.

Selfish genes (coupled with deleterious alleles) are one possible genetic mechanism that could be deployed to suppress pest populations. We develop a population dynamics model describing how such control may be effective from a theoretical perspective, using a bark beetle – conifer system as a case study . We consider a cellular automaton model, allowing diffusion of beetles between cells, and assess whether beetle populations can be suppressed and maintained below outbreak thresholds. We found, that for biologically-relevant parameter values, this selfish genetic element is maintained in the population and that local beetle populations became suppressed or extirpated without substantially depleting their conifer resource. Under certain conditions, beetle movements between cells were sufficient to maintain suppressed beetle populations, which suggests that genetic control of bark beetle pests may be possible.","tags":[""],"title":"Can selfish genes help prevent pest outbreaks?","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Heather L Major","Alex M.

The ability to assess population trends and delineate important wildlife areas remains a top priority for managers and conservation biologists. Yet, outdated labourious estimation methods remain in high use. By simulating known populations on known island sizes and using established transect and quadrat survey methods we asked whether using inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolations in ArcGIS improved estimates of colony area and population size for nocturnal burrow-nesting seabirds over conventional global interpolation methods. We performed 100 simulations for each of three population sizes (500, 1000, and 50 000 breeding pairs) on three island sizes (10 ha, 50 ha, and 500 ha), excluding the largest population size on the smallest island size, for a total of 800 simulated islands. We estimated colony area and population size for each simulated island using both IDW interpolations and an established global interpolation method. Accuracy of each estimate was then calculated and using an information theoretic approach we found that IDW interpolation estimates were overall more accurate when estimating population size but we found no difference in colony area accuracy between interpolation methods. We recommend using IDW interpolations to estimate colony area and population size along with consistency in survey structure both among study sites and years. We also recommend maintaining a consistent transect length whenever possible to ensure observer bias does not influence areas surveyed.","tags":"","title":"Estimating colony and breeding population size for nocturnal burrow-nesting seabirds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I upgraded to using Mendeley v 1.5 (because previous versions don't work on Ubuntu 12.04 Precise) and I had problems installing the OpenOffice plugin.

This feature is coming soon to Mendeley!\nSeveral journals require abbreviated journal names, but as of yet Mendeley doesn't make this possible. Or so I thought. After coming across this blog post I decided to try to get this functionality working on my computers.\nTo summarize, you can get Mendeley to read in a list of abbreviated journal names by:\n creating a folder inside the Mendeley data directory called \u0026lsquo;journalAbbreviations'; placing a formatted text file named \u0026lsquo;default.txt\u0026rsquo; inside this directory. Each line of this text file needs to contain the full name of the journal, a tab character, and the abbreviated journal name.  \u0026ldquo;Easy\u0026rdquo;, I thought. All I needed was to find a list of full journal names and their abbreviations for my field and make sure it was formatted correctly. Turns out the few lists I did find were incomplete: they didn't have all the journals I cite. I don't want to have to maintain a text file by hand, so I looked to a more \u0026ldquo;automated\u0026rdquo; approach, outlined below.\nI use both BibTeX and Mendeley for my references, and have setup Mendeley to automagically update and maintain my bibliography (.bib) files. This is key to obtaining a list of the journals I use - I extracted this info from the .bib files and compared this list of journals against the master list to get the abbreviations.\nFirst, I obtained (by hand, sadly) a list of all the ISI journals indexed by Web of Science from this site I copy/pasted all the journals into a text file named \u0026lsquo;masterlist.txt'.I wrote a script to generate a master list of all journal names and their abbreviations from Web of Science (see this post). This file is pretty big, and not very helpful at that point. I don't need ALL of those journals, only the journals I cite from my Mendeley library.\nThe Perl script I wrote (with Charlie and Filipe) does all of this and saves the list of journals used directly into the Mendeley data folder.\nTo get this working yourself, follow the steps below:\nNOTE: This was written for and tested on a machine running Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit with a default Mendeley installation (also tested and run on Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10). IT WON'T WORK ON WINDOWS OR A MAC WITHOUT SOME CHANGES TO THE PERL SCRIPT because the Mendeley directories are in different places on different operating systems. There may be some funny perl-related issues going between OSes too that I'm not aware of.\n  Download and save jabbrev.zip and unzip the directory \u0026lsquo;jabbrev\u0026rsquo;\n  open a terminal (and keep it open) and type:\ncd path/to/jabbrev   In Mendeley go to \u0026lsquo;Tools\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;Options\u0026rsquo; and select the \u0026lsquo;BibTeX\u0026rsquo; tab.\n  Check the box \u0026lsquo;Enable BibTeX syncing\u0026rsquo; and select either: \u0026lsquo;Create one BibTeX file for my whole library\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Create one BibTeX file per collection\u0026rsquo;\n  Set the path to where these BibTeX files will be saved (e.g., ~/Documents/Mendeley/bibliographies).\n  Click \u0026lsquo;Apply\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;OK', wait for Mendeley to generate the files, then exit Mendeley.\n  In a nautilus window, go to the bibliographies directory you just set up (e.g., ~/Documents/Mendeley/bibliographies)\n  Switch back to your open terminal window and allow the script to be executed by typing:\nchmod a+x script.pl   The script accepts a filepath for each of the masterlist and multiple bibtex files. Execute the script by typing:\n./script.pl /path/to/masterlist.txt /path/to/bibfile1.bib [/path/to/bibfile2.bib ...]   Sit back and wait (it may take a while to run, especially with a large library!).\n  Open Mendeley back up, go to \u0026lsquo;View\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;Citation Style\u0026rsquo; \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;More Styles\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; and select a citation format that uses abbreviated journal names (e.g., Vancouver). You should now be able to generate bibliographies in Word and Open(Libre)Office documents with abbrev j names!*\n  *note that the abbreviated names do NOT have periods.\nEDIT: view the perl script at http://pastebin.com/2C7X8aGZ [updated 2013-02-27]. It's not perfect (yet) but it's mostly there.

Larvae that pupate in an aggregation rather than in solitude may experience a lower rate of parasitism by the parasitoid Mastrus ridibundus. Additionally, adults eclosing from a larval aggregation may encounter mates more rapidly at the site of eclosion (on-site) than away from that site (off-site). We employed an evolutionary simulation to determine the effect of several ecological parameters on the evolution of larval aggregation behavior. These parameters included (i) the probability of mate encounter off-site; (ii) the time available for finding a mate; and (iii) the population density of parasitoids and their rate of larval parasitism. The model predicts that larval aggregation behavior is selected for when the probability of off-site mate encounter is low, the time to locate mates is short, and egg-limited parasitoids are at high population levels. We also show that aggregations reduce the risk of parasitism through dilution effects. The parameters found to favour the evolution of larval aggregation behavior are consistent with life history traits exhibited by C. pomonella.","tags":[],"title":"A Theoretical Approach to Study the Evolution of Aggregation Behavior by Larval Codling Moth, Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernard D.

We will use 2 examples that illustrate how we study in these problems theoretically and experimentally. In the first example, a foraging parasitic wasp depletes a patch of hosts that may harbour predators. We develop a dynamic state variable model to predict when a wasp will exit such a patch and then test our predictions in controlled experiments. In the second example, we explore the role of energy limitation in a bark beetle making host (habitat) selection decisions.

We present a dynamic state variable model of individual beetle host selection behaviour, based on an individual's energy state. Field data are incorporated into model parameterization which allows us to determine the effects of host availability (with respect to host size, quality, and vigour) on individuals' decisions. Beetles choose larger trees with thicker phloem across a larger proportion of the state-space than smaller trees with thinner phloem, but accept lower quality trees more readily at low energy- and time-states. In addition, beetles make habitat selection decisions based on host availability, conspecific attack densities, and beetle distributions within a forest stand.

This search for a host involves both visual and olfactory cues, including beetle-produced pheromones involved in ‘mass attack' which is required to overcome host defences. Beetles can be choosy while making host selection decisions, discriminating based on host size, quality, and defensive capability, as well as conspecific (attack) densities. However, the extent of their ‘choosiness' appears to be modulated by individual energy (i.e. lipid) reserves. A stochastic dynamic programming model of individual beetle host-selection, based on an individual's energy state, is presented. Field data are incorporated into model parameterization and the effects of host availability, quality, and vigour on individual's decisions and their subsequent implications for attack dynamics of the population are discussed.","tags":[""],"title":"An individual model of host selection for mountain pine beetle","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alex M.

Female beetles have a limited period of time to find a suitable tree to breed and lay her eggs in. However, to successfully reproduce the beetle must overcome host defences and kill the host tree. How beetles distribute themselves on particular host trees will be largely affected by the density of other beetles, since individual beetles on their own are incapable of successfully colonizing and killing a host tree. I use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to explore how Mountain Pine Beetle searches for and selects host trees in which to reproduce. I develop a dynamic state variable model to first evaluate individual host acceptance decisions. However, individual decisions may be contingent on the decisions of conspecifics, therefore, the decision-making policies of the beetles as a population should be treated as a game. Thus, I use a game theory approach to evaluate the policies of beetles leading to stable decision policies. A combination of field and experimental work will be used to test various components of the model before it is scaled up into a spatially-explicit forest landscape model.","tags":[""],"title":"Using game theory to evaluate host acceptance decisions in mountain pine beetle","type":"talk"}]

title: Finding Symbol Commands for LaTeX

Ever been writing a document in [latex]\LaTeX[/latex] and had to look up the code for a particular symbol? Google usually directs me to the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/" target="_blank">Comprehesive LaTeX Symbol List</a> but scrolling through and finding the symbol I'm looking for is time consuming. However, today I came across this site (<a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/" target="_blank">Detexify</a>) which lets you draw the symbol you are looking for and it tries to match it, providing symbol suggestions and letting you know the [latex]\LaTeX[/latex]Â code and the package to use!

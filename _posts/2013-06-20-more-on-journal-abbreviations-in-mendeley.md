  content: ! 'Thanks Alex.  It can be painful for us to see everyone screaming for
    a feature but not being in a position to make any progress towards it, so I''m
    glad we''re finally able to address this.  Between this, the iOS release, and
    a few other surprises, August is going to be a great month for Mendeley users
    :)


    Note: I should update the feedback ticket, but expected release is late August,
    not the start of August.'

Wow, my [other]({% post_url 2012-02-28-list-of-abbreviated-journal-names %}) [posts]({% post_url 2012-02-09-abbreviated-journal-names-in-mendeley-updated %}) on the topic are getting a lot of hits!

Some exciting info for anyone still struggling with getting abbreviated journal names working with Mendeley: [this feature is coming soon](http://feedback.mendeley.com/forums/4941-general/suggestions/83173-journal-abbreviations?tracking_code=36d3a06b5cba533f95b15ede1b570435)!

> This is currently on our roadmap for Mendeley Desktop 1.10. Expected release date is the start of August.

From the mockups and descriptions the good folks at Mendeley have provided it looks like they're doing a great job of addressing this shortcoming of their current product.

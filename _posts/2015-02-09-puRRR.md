In preparing a presentation on developing R packages using RStudio for the Victoria R Users Meetup Group this month, organizer Kiri Whan and I put together a very simple demo R package.

*UPDATE 2015/02/09: I didn't notice the conflict with the package name; thanks Scott Chamberlain for [pointing it out](https://twitter.com/recology_/status/565037285507215362). I've renamed the package to `meow` and updated the links below.*

From the `README` at [https://github.com/achubaty/meow](https://github.com/achubaty/meow):

## `puRRR`: Get random pictures of cats.

This package doesn't do much, but it's adorable:

Use `meow()` to fetch a random cat photo from [http://thecatapi.com](http://thecatapi.com) plot it in yor R session. Meow!

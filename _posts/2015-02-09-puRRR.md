In preparing a presentation on developing R packages using RStudio for the Victoria R Users Meetup Group this month, organizer Kiri Whan and I put together a very simple demo R package.

From the `README` at https://github.com/achubaty/puRRR:

`puRRR`: Get random pictures of cats.

This package doesn't do much, but it's adorable:

Use `meow()` to fetch a random cat photo from http://thecatapi.com plot it in yor R session. Meow!

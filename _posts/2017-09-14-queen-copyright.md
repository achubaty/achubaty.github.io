A [number](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/585955759525007360) [of](http://www.pieceofk.fr/?p=431) [people](https://twitter.com/hspter/status/908263547167277056) have been surprised to learn that Her Majesty the Queen is listed as an author on a number of our packages.
For example, in the [`SpaDES`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES) package:

```
Author:	Alex M Chubaty [aut, cre],
        Eliot J B McIntire [aut],
        Yong Luo [ctb],
        Steve Cumming [ctb],
        Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by
         the Minister of Natural Resources Canada [cph]
```

Note, however, that Her Majesty's [role](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html#author) not as a package *author* (`aut`) but as the *copyright holder* (`cph`).

It's common practice in many companies to attribute copyright to your employer, and there are several R packages that list a company as copyright holder.
For example, take a look at the packages produced by RStudio (*e.g.*, [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr), [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2)).

As a Canadian public servant, the Crown holds copyright on our work, including R packages.
(Next time you're reading a scientific paper produced by a federal employee note the copyright -- most publishers assign Crown Copyright in these cases instead of the publisher itself maintaining copyright. *E.g.*, [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/our-business/policies/copyright#Government-employees).)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Queen Elizabeth II has another <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash">#rstats</a> package on CRAN. This one&#39;s for reproducible research. <a href="https://t.co/T71aefEPTL">https://t.co/T71aefEPTL</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Leeper (@thosjleeper) <a href="https://twitter.com/thosjleeper/status/894176471392059392">August 6, 2017</a></blockquote>

So while it may be a little surprising to see The Queen listed (as copyright holder) in the authors list for several R packages, assigning copyright to one's employer is common in general, and expected for public servants in Canada (and likely other Commonwealth countries).

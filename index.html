    <p><em>Alex Chubaty is a postdoctoral researcher developing landscape-level models of insect dispersal and forest disturbance. He completed his PhD in Biological Sciences at SFU, examining the population-level effects of energy and time constraints on individual behaviour.</em></p>

  	<p>Broadly, I am interested in understanding how individual variation, especially in physiological state (e.g., energy, age), affects population- and community-level processes. I consider how individuals make behavioural decisions (i.e., mechanisms) as well as their outcomes. In particular, my research focusses on habitat selection and dispersal.</p>
	<p>I use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, encompassing field and lab work together with mathematical modeling and analysis.</p>
	<p>In addition to research, I have actively pursued many teaching opportunities and pride myself on adapting my teaching style to best suit my students' abilities and learning styles. I place strong emphasis on understanding and communicating concepts as opposed to rote memorization of details, while encouraging students' questions and active participation.</p>

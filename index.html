    <p>I am broadly interested in exploring impacts of host selection and dispersal at multiple spatial scales as well as scaling up from individual-based behavioural models to population-, communityÂ­, and even landscape-level models of insect outbreak and disturbance.</p>
	<p>I use a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, encompassing field and lab work together with mathematical modeling and analysis.</p>
	<p>In addition to research, I have actively pursued many teaching opportunities and pride myself on adapting my teaching style to best suit my students' abilities and learning styles. I place strong emphasis on understanding and communicating concepts as opposed to rote memorization of details, while encouraging students' questions and active participation.</p>

  <h1>Biography</h1>
  <p><em>Alex Chubaty is a postdoctoral researcher developing landscape models of dispersal. He completed his PhD program at SFU, examining the population-level effects of energy and time constraints on individual behaviour.</em></p>

  <p>In addition to research, I have actively pursued many teaching opportunities and pride myself on adapting my teaching style to best suit my students' abilities and learning styles. I place strong emphasis on understanding and communicating concepts as opposed to rote memorization of details, while encouraging students' questions and active participation.</p>

  <p>During my grad studies I have become a proficient computer programmer and an open-source software enthusiast, and I'm excited about applying these tools and techniques to solve a wide range of problems.</p>

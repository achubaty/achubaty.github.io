	<p>In addition to research, I have actively pursued many teaching opportunities and pride myself on adapting my teaching style to best suit my students' abilities and learning styles. I place strong emphasis on understanding and communicating concepts as opposed to rote memorization of details, while encouraging students' questions and active participation.</p>
  	<p>During my grad studies I have become a proficient computer programmer and an open-source software enthusiast, and I'm excited about applying these tools and techniques to solve a wide range of problems.</p>

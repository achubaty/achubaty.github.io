          <h2>Essential software for biology grad students: Part I Overview</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jul 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>When I started grad school, I had no idea at the time just how much I&#39;d learn doing a PhD. I&#39;m not just talking about the &quot;big picture&quot; stuff: how to do research, design and conduct experiments, analyze data, and synthesize information. I mean all of the day-to-day skills associated with academic writing, data entry, and organization.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, I&#39;ll explain a bit about the workflows I use and the various pieces of software that make my life quite a bit easier.Â After numerous discussions with colleagues over the years, providing various software and workflow recommendations to others, and attending (and running) various software workshops, it turns out I have a lot of suggestions for fellow biology grad students.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to keep my recommendations general, because I think they are applicable not just to grad students in biology, but are also likely of interest to undergrads (even post-grads) in the sciences and perhaps elsewhere. I won&#39;t put together detailed <em>How-To</em>&#39;s, and I won&#39;t be able to cover everything, but here&#39;s an overview of what to expect:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/software/2013/07/11/essential-software-for-biology-grad-students-part-ii-backups-and-sync.html">Part II</a> will cover some essential computing basics: automated backups, using online (cloud) storage, and version control;</li>
<li><a href="/latex/software/writing/2013/07/15/essential-software-for-biology-grad-students-part-iii-writing-tools.html">Part III</a> will deal with different writing tools including Microsoft Word, Libre Office Writer, Markdown, Pandoc, and LaTeX;</li>
<li><strong>Part IV</strong> will discuss reference management and citation software options;</li>
<li><strong>Part V</strong> will touch on using databases instead of spreadsheets;</li>
<li><strong>Part VI</strong> will delve into statistics software and the majestic use of R for stats, graphics, and (if I have time) get into using Sweave with R and LaTeX;</li>
<li><strong>Part VII</strong> will go into a little bit about programming and shell scripting;</li>
<li>and finally, <strong>Part VIII</strong> will wrap things all up.</li>
</ul>

<p>So stay tuned! I&#39;m still fleshing out my ideas on some of these topics, so as we go along I look forward to comments and suggestions.</p>

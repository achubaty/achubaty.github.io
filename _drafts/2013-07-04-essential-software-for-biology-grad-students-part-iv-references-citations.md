<p>There is absolutely no reason why anyone should ever have to manually input a citations in text or in the references section of their document. It pains me so much to hear undergrads or grad students say they "spent all night formatting the references" or that they were "going to use APA format but it took too much time". If you take anything away from this series of posts, I want you to start using a reference and citation manager.</p>
<p>I'm going to talk about <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> because it's one of the best reference managers out there, and it's what I use. Of course, there are other options out there, including <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, <a href="http://endnote.com">Endnote</a>, and <a href="http://www.refworks.com/">RefWorks</a>. I recommend Mendeley: it's free, crossplatform, and integrates nicely with Microsoft Word and Libre Office Writer. It also has a slough of delicious features which I'll highlight below.</p>
<h2>Why use a reference manager?</h2>
<p>Before going into detail about Mendeley, I should explain why use a reference manager at all. Firstly, it helps you maintain an indexed, searchable library of your reference materials (PDF journal articles, books, etc.). Secondly, it allows you to quickly and easily insert citations into your documents and change citation styles as needed. Both of these tasks, if done manually, require a substantial amount of time and organization. As it turns out, repetitive and labourious tasks are exactly what computers do quickly and well!</p>

<ul>
<li>Mendeley pros:
<ul>
<li>full featured, and it keeps improving*</li>
<li>online backup and synch between all my computers (and phone!) &lt;-- cross-platform and web interface</li>
<li>decent amount of free online storage space</li>
<li>decent collaboration features: public and private groups to share reference libraries</li>
<li>"social networking" aspect allows you to keep up on what others you follow are reading - great for discovering papers!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mendeley cons:
<ul>
<li>as mentioned above (*) things are improving as features get added, but there are a few instances where I had to hack around some limitations in Mendeley</li>
<li>recently purchased and now owned by the evil Elsevier</li>
</ul>

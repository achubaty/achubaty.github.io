<li><span style="color: #444444;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Programming &amp; scripting.</b>Â Be it Python, C, or R, basic programming skills are very important. I suppose there are students who don't "need" to code ever, but I till think it's incredibly useful. At the very least, something simple like shell scripting comes in handy when you need to do repetitive tasks like batch file processing.</span></span></li>

### Education

**PhD, Biological Sciences** (2013) Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC

- Thesis: "Individual host selection decisions and population-level responses in a time- and energy-limited forager, *Dendroctonus ponderosae* Hopkins" ([https://theses.lib.sfu.ca/thesis/etd8060](https://theses.lib.sfu.ca/thesis/etd8060))
